This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Enhancements (if there was more time)


#### Code
- further code splitting into smaller components (eg headings, subheadings, inputs)
- tests for more complex components (form submissions, api requests)
- improved error handling. 

#### Data
- integrate google places autocomplete to look up specific locations (additional benefit of returning lat & lon, which would save having to do 2 api calls to openweathermap)
- forecasted pollen levels from additional apis

#### UI/UX 
- breakdown of forecasted hourly weather as chart (including precipitation, humidity, wind)
- display forecasted days as slideable carousel, rather than grid.
- integrate location of user using navigator.geolocation 
- imagery from unsplash (or otherwise)
- forecasted days clickable, showing hourly breakdown (and more data) for that day.
